## 2.6.4

  - [#181](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/181)/[#182](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/182) -
    Controller metadata methods should only be evaluated when `paper_trail_enabled_for_controller == true`.
  - [#177](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/issues/177)/[#178](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/178) -
    Factored out `version_key` into it's own method to prevent `ConnectionNotEstablished` error from getting thrown in
    instances where `has_paper_trail` is declared on class prior to ActiveRecord establishing a connection.
  - [#176](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/176) - Force metadata calls for attributes to use current value
    if attribute value is changing.
  - [#173](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/173) - Update link to [diff-lcs](https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs).
  - [#172](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/172) - Save `object_changes` on creation.
  - [#168](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/168) - Respect conditional `:if` or `:unless` arguments to the
    `has_paper_trail` method for `destroy` events.
  - [#167](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/167) - Fix `originator` method so that it works with subclasses and STI.
  - [#160](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/160) - Fixed failing tests and resolved out of date dependency issues.
  - [#157](https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/157) - Refactored `class_attribute` names on the `ClassMethods` module
    for names that are not obviously pertaining to PaperTrail to prevent method name collision.
